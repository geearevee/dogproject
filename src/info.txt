API Reference: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/ 
Task: 
- Build a Dog Gallery website. 
- The website should show all the dog breeds and an image (See below for reference). 

- Users should be able to filter the dog list by entering the breed name. - When the user clicks on a breed, he/she should be able to see the sub-breeds of the dog along with more images of the breed. (See below image for reference)

- When the user clicks on the “Custom Search” button, he/she should be able to see the provided number of images of the selected breed. (See below image for reference)

Technicals: 
1. Create a Dog Gallery Home Page. 
2. Fetch the list of breeds using the API - https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all (Check Documentation) 
3. For each breed, Fetch a Random image of the dog by breed - 
https://dog.ceo/api/breed/<dog-breed>/images/random (Check Documentation) 4. Implement Search. Users should be able to filter the list of breeds by breed name. (You will have to write a function to filter the list of breeds) 
5. On Click of a Dog Breed, Show a Modal with Header as the Dog Breed Name. 6. The Modal should have two sections 
a. Sub-Breeds Section: 
i. Fetch the list of sub-breeds of a dog breed.

iii. Show the photos from the API under the heading - “Showing <number-of-images> images of <dog-breed-name>”
Evaluation Criteria (What do we look for in your code?) 
1. Code Readability and Organisation. (How easy is it to read and understand your code?) 
2. API calls and Data usage (How are you calling the API endpoints and using the data in your code?) 
3. Code Reusability (How structured and reusable is your code?) 4. Necessary Validations (How are you checking for human errors in your code?) 5. Bonus: Testing (How reliable is your code?)
